Hello & welcome! This website is home to my projects, ramblings, and updates. Hope you stick around! :dizzy:

I'm a bioinformatician at [AnaptysBio](https://www.anaptysbio.com/), an antibody development company focusing on inflammatory diseases. I mostly analyze NGS data on antibody repertoires (:mouse: and :man:). 

I would say Iâ€™m *mainly* self-taught, I learned Python basics during my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz. I started out as a molecular biologist and transitioned to bioinformatics once I incorporated programming into my work.

**Whatâ€™s next?**

Currently, I hope to obtain a Ph.D. in genomics or computational immunology. I have pretty broad interests ranging from evolutionary genomics to cancer biology. ðŸ§¬
