Hello & welcome! This website is home to my projects, ramblings, and updates. Hope you stick around! :dizzy:

I'm a bioinformatician at [AnaptysBio](https://www.anaptysbio.com/), an antibody development company focusing on inflammatory diseases. I primarily analyze NGS data of antibody repertoires (:mouse: and :man:).

I would say Iâ€™m *mostly* self-taught, I learned Python basics during my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz. After graduating a year early, I started as a molecular biologist before transitioning to bioinformatics once I incorporated programming into my work.

**Whatâ€™s next?**

I hope to obtain a Ph.D. in bioengineering, bioinformatics, or genomics! I have pretty broad interests ranging from ML-guided protein design to cancer genomics. ðŸ§¬
