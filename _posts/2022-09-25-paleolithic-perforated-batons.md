# What are perforated batons?
Perforated batons are made of antler, and contain at least one hole. More than 400 batons have been discovered across Europe,  dating from the Upper Paleolithic to the Early Mesolithic. Batons dating to the Boreal and Early Atlantic period of the Mesolithic range from lengths 40-50cm, while Atlantic batons are longer at 50-70cm.

# What was the function of perforated batons?
Despite the large numbers of perforated batons discovered, there is no conclusion to their function. ~70% of paleolithic batons are broken, with use wear patterns differing, but it is certain that an object is passed through it. What exactly was passed through is unclear, and several hypothesis have been made for their use:

- **Symbols of Authority**: When the first perforated baton was discovered in 1867 by Édouard Lartet and Henry Christy, they were impressed by the intricate engravings. They called the batons "bâtons de commandement": batons are a representation of authority and power. However as more were discovered, and their use patterns analyzed, this has become a less popular hypothesis.
- **Spear/Arrow Straighteners**
- **Making Rope**: Rigaud demonstrated how perforated batons can be used to twist and manipulate rope, and even showed how this proposed function can cause pressure and mimic the pattern of breakage found in many batons.

- **Spear thrower**: By using the perforated batons, spears could be thrown further with less force and wear on the body. It has been found to increase range by 127% (David Wescott, 1999). Someone actually demonstrated how to throw a javelin with a perforated baton (30+ yards!). Check it out on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-DJiih0vzM).

# Murray Springs Shaft Wrench
A tool resembling European perforated batons was discovered in Arizona in 1967. It is made of mammoth bone, lacks engravings, and shows significant wear at the top and bottom of the hole. Gary Haynes hypothesized it was used for spear straightening.
