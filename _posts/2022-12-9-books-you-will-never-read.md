This post is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcb2oLSb7Cs) by TREY the Explainer on YouTube! I mostly talk about lost ancient Greek texts, and I hope to expand to more in the future! 

# You will never read the following books
These texts have been lost, with no existing copies discovered. How do we know about them in the first place? From surviving works that mention them and in some lucky cases, include excerpts or short snippets. Only fragments remain, and the full literary work has been lost to time.

# Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric model
Aristarchus of Samos was a Greek astronomer who lived between 310-280 BCE. He was the **first individual to put forward the heliocentric model** in which the Earth revolves around the Sun. Aristarchus may have been inspired by [Philolaus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/), who proposed that our solar system orbits around a central fire. Aristarchus's model was rejected in favor of the popular and widely accepted geocentric model that places the Earth at the center of the universe. Fortunately, his theory was preserved by Archimedes in his work *The Sand Reckoner*, a treatise that estimates the size of the universe to find out how much sand it takes to fill it.

# Any firsthand account of Alexander the Great
Any primary source who knew Alexander the Great has been lost. However, they served as sources for many books which survive and contain fragments of primary source material. This includes writings from Alexander's historian Callisthenes (his great-uncle was Aristotle!), generals Ptolemy (who became Pharaoh) and Nearchus (admiral who explored India), Aristobulus (architect and close friend who traveled with Alexander throughout Asia), and Onesicritus (criticized for exaggerating his rank and being an overall... *unreliable* source).

As for which accounts were used in the main sources today, Arrian explains himself:

> *But in my opinion the narratives of Ptolemy and Aristobulus are more worthy of credit than the rest; Aristobulus, because he served under king Alexander in his expedition, and Ptolemy, not only because he accompanied Alexander in his expedition, but also because he was himself a king afterwards"*

# Anaximander's evolutionary theory
Anaximander was a Greek philosopher who lived between 610-546 BC. Among other notable contributions, including accurate predictions of the equinox using the sundial, he proposed that **humans descended from fish** after water evaporated on Earth. Anaximander argued that humans couldn't have started from helpless infants, but rather evolved from fish who are independent after hatching. He also may have developed this idea by looking at fossils. His concept didn't catch on, but he was on the right track... Darwin introduced evolution some 2,000 years later. 

Only fragments of his work remain, but it would've been fascinating to read more about his justification of evolution.
