My name is Grace Jacobson! I grew up outside Portland, OR and went to high school in Davis. I held an internship at the UC Davis Genome Center in high school focused on resistance genes in lettuce and won a scholarship. At UC Santa Cruz, I majored in molecular biology and took a course on Python programming. I discovered my passion for bioinformatics by applying it to my first full-time job in industry.

In my free time, I enjoy video games, skiing, and trying out new boba places!
