My name is Grace Jacobson! I grew up outside Portland, OR and went to high school in Davis. I held an internship at the UC Davis Genome Center in high school. At UC Santa Cruz, I majored in molecular biology and took a course on Python programming. I discovered my passion for bioinformatics by applying it to my first full-time job in industry. I hope to attend graduate school to study epigenomics or genomics. 

In my free time, I enjoy video games, skiing, and trying out new boba places!
