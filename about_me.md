Hi, my name is Grace Jacobson! I grew up outside Portland, OR and went to high school in Davis, CA. I held an internship at the UC Davis Genome Center in high school focused on resistance genes in lettuce and **won a scholarship** from Monsanto for my project. I went to **UC Santa Cruz** and majored in molecular biology. After graduating a year early, I discovered my passion for bioinformatics by applying it to my first full-time job in industry. I work in antibody discovery and focus on **high throughput repertoire analysis**. I'm currently applying to graduate school to study genomics or epigenomics.

In my free time, I enjoy video games, skiing, and trying out new boba places!
