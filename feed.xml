How do we know about them in the first place? From surviving works that mention them and in some lucky cases, include excerpts or short snippets. Only fragments remain, and the full literary work has been lost to time.</p> <h1 id="aristarchus-of-samoss-heliocentric-model">Aristarchus of Samos’s heliocentric model</h1> <p>Aristarchus of Samos was a Greek astronomer who lived between 310-280 BCE. He was the <strong>first individual to put forward the heliocentric model</strong> in which the Earth revolves around the Sun. Aristarchus may have been inspired by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/">Philolaus</a>, who proposed that our solar system orbits around a central fire. Aristarchus’s model was rejected in favor of the popular and widely accepted geocentric model that places the Earth at the center of the universe. Fortunately, his theory was preserved by Archimedes in his work <em>The Sand Reckoner</em>, a treatise that estimates the size of the universe to find out how much sand it takes to fill it.</p> <div class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/aristarchus-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/aristarchus-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/aristarchus-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aristarchus.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="350" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> 10th century AD copy of Aristarchus' calculations of Earth, Sun, and Moon sizes. </div> <h1 id="any-firsthand-account-of-alexander-the-great">Any firsthand account of Alexander the Great</h1> <p>Any primary source who knew Alexander the Great has been lost. However, they served as sources for many books which survive and contain fragments of primary source material. This includes writings from Alexander’s historian Callisthenes (his great-uncle was Aristotle!), generals Ptolemy (who became Pharaoh) and Nearchus (admiral who explored India), Aristobulus (architect and close friend who traveled with Alexander throughout Asia), and Onesicritus (criticized for exaggerating his rank and being an overall… <em>unreliable</em> source).</p> <div class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/alexander_empire-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/alexander_empire-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/alexander_empire-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/alexander_empire.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Alexander the Great's Empire. </div> <p>As for which accounts were used in the main sources today, Arrian explains himself:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>But in my opinion the narratives of Ptolemy and Aristobulus are more worthy of credit than the rest; Aristobulus, because he served under king Alexander in his expedition, and Ptolemy, not only because he accompanied Alexander in his expedition, but also because he was himself a king afterwards”</em></p> <p>Arrian, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46976/46976-h/46976-h.htm">Anabasis Alexandri</a></p> </blockquote> <h1 id="anaximanders-evolutionary-theory">Anaximander’s evolutionary theory</h1> <p>Anaximander was a Greek philosopher who lived between 610-546 BC. Among other notable contributions, including accurate predictions of the equinox using the sundial, he proposed that <strong>humans descended from fish</strong> after water evaporated on Earth. Anaximander argued that humans couldn’t have started from helpless infants, but rather evolved from fish who are independent after hatching. He also may have developed this idea by looking at fossils. His concept didn’t catch on, but he was on the right track… Darwin introduced evolution some 2,000 years later.</p> <p>Only fragments of his work remain, but it would’ve been fascinating to read more about his justification of evolution.</p> <div class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/walking_fish-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/walking_fish-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/walking_fish-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/walking_fish.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Tiktaalik, the first known vertebrate on land. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ramblings"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post…]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">mitochondrial eve</title><link href="https://gracejacobson.github.io//blog/2022/mitochondrial-eve/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="mitochondrial eve"/><published>2022-10-20T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-20T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gracejacobson.github.io//blog/2022/mitochondrial-eve</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gracejacobson.github.io//blog/2022/mitochondrial-eve/"><![CDATA[<p>In this post:</p> <ul id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#what-is-mitochondrial-eve" id="markdown-toc-what-is-mitochondrial-eve">What is mitochondrial Eve?</a></li> <li><a href="#what-is-mitochondrial-dna" id="markdown-toc-what-is-mitochondrial-dna">What is mitochondrial DNA?</a></li> <li><a href="#what-do-we-know-about-mitochondrial-eve" id="markdown-toc-what-do-we-know-about-mitochondrial-eve">What do we know about mitochondrial Eve?</a></li> <li><a href="#what-are-some-misconceptions-about-mitochondrial-eve" id="markdown-toc-what-are-some-misconceptions-about-mitochondrial-eve">What are some misconceptions about mitochondrial eve?</a></li> <li><a href="#what-about-adam" id="markdown-toc-what-about-adam">What about Adam?</a></li> <li><a href="#references" id="markdown-toc-references">References</a></li> </ul> <hr/> <h1 id="what-is-mitochondrial-eve">What is mitochondrial Eve?</h1> <p>Mitochondrial eve is the most recent matrilineal common ancestor.

More than 400 batons have been discovered across Europe, dating from the Upper Paleolithic to the Early Mesolithic.

What exactly was passed through is unclear, and several hypothesis have been made for their use:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Symbols of Authority</strong>: When the first perforated baton was discovered in 1867 by Édouard Lartet and Henry Christy, they were impressed by the intricate engravings. They called the batons “bâtons de commandement”: batons are a representation of authority and power. However as more were discovered, and their use patterns analyzed, this has become a less popular hypothesis.</li> <li><strong>Spear/Arrow Straighteners</strong></li> <li><strong>Making Rope</strong>: Rigaud demonstrated how perforated batons can be used to twist and manipulate rope, and even showed how this proposed function can cause pressure and mimic the pattern of breakage found in many batons.</li> </ul> <div class="text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Rope_aid-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Rope_aid-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Rope_aid-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Rope_aid.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="300" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption">Use as an aid for making rope (Rigaud, 2004). </div> <ul> <li><strong>Spear thrower</strong>: By using the perforated batons, spears could be thrown further with less force and wear on the body. It has been found to increase range by 127% (David Wescott, 1999). Someone actually demonstrated how to throw a javelin with a perforated baton (30+ yards!).
