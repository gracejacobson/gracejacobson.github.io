# About Me <br>

![Programmer_Day](/assets/Programmer_Day.gif)
I'm Grace Jacobson, a budding bioinformatician currently working at [AnaptysBio](https://www.anaptysbio.com/). I learned Python during my last quarter of college and discovered my passion for bioinformatics by applying it to my first full-time job in industry. I have a strong wet-lab background in molecular biology and held an internship at the UC Davis Genome Center in high school. I hope to attend graduate school to study epigenomics or genomics. In my free time, I enjoy video games, skiing, and trying out new boba places!
